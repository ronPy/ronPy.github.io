              <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
			  <p>I was born in October 22, 1983. I lived all my life in Fernando de la Mora, Paraguay - South America.</p>
              <p>I started doing web development with PHP back in 2002, I moved to RoR by 2007 and didn't look back since, I just love the framework, I don't hate PHP at all, but I'll stick with RoR for almost everything I have to do.</p>			  
			  <p>My development environment is my MacBook, I use Texmate or Mac Vim as text editor, and the Terminal is my best friend for the past couple of years.</p>
			  <p>I have great experience working with other developers in the same project, also improving and maintaining existing codes; working alone is not a problem for me, as a matter of fact, I've been doing that at my current job position for the last year and a half, but to be honest, I always prefer to work with other developers.</p>
			  <p>Some time ago I also worked as team leader which was a good experience, it helped me a lot with time distribution and task management for a team of developers, as for myself of course.</p>
			  <p>One of the things I enjoy is to try new technologies, languages and platforms; I don't see myself as someone close minded when it comes to use specific tools in a project, I can easily adapt to any team structure.</p>
			  <p>Even though I've worked all my life as a developer, I always felt a deep passion for graphic design, that's why I love to get my hands on PSDs and create websites from scratch. I enjoy doing responsive layouts, writing CSS3 and debugging Javascript.</p>

              <h1>SKILLS</h1>
			  <p>I've worked only with PHP for the first 5 years in my professional life, I still do some small sites with PHP.</p>
              <p>I work with RoR for the last 7 years, creating websites with high traffic and web based apps to manipulate big amount of data.</p>
              <p>Lately I've been doing desktop apps (for Windows only) written in C#, the app involves browser extensions / addons (for Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome) and it has a RoR app to manage campaigns, updates, installation reports amongst other things.</p>
			  <p>When in comes to databases, I always preferred MySQL, but I've worked with PostgreSQL and SQL Server before, also I was involved in some small projects using Oracle.</p>
			  <p>I've used <a href="http://sphinxsearch.com/">Sphinx</a> as search engine for some of the sites I've been working on in last couple of years.</p>
			  <p>For high traffic sites, I used to work with <a href="http://memcached.org/" target="_blank">MemCached</a>, but lately I've tried <a href="http://varnish-cache.org/" target="_blank">Varnish</a> (awesome tool btw).</p>
			  <p>I have really good Javascript knowledge, as I enjoy working on front-end development, I've worked with many libraries, likes MooTools, Prototype and jQuery.</p>
			  <p>I manage my own servers, installing all the services my projects needs. I've worked with CentOS, Ubuntu server and Debian. so I have years installing and configuring Apache, Passenger, Sphinx and when is needed Sendmail or Postfix.</p>
			  <p>Usually I create the HTML and CSS files from scratch, but I've some experience working with CMS like Wordpress and Joomla, I haven't done much with them though.</p>
			  <p>I have done a lot of APIs implementation and some development aswell.</p>
			  <p>Photoshop is an everyday tool for the past 10 years, even if I'm working with a designer I use it for small things just to save time instead of ask for it and wait, I guess the real reason is that I really enjoy to work with it.</p>
			  <p>I've worked in a TV and Radio Broadcast Station for some years developing desktop and web based apps, mounted an <a href="http://www.icecast.org/" target="_blank">Icecast 2</a> server for live audio streaming and a <a href="http://www.wowza.com/products" target="_blank">Wowza Streaming Engine</a> server for live video streaming.</p>
			  <p>Some of the languages I don't have much experience with, but at least I have a chance to work with are ObjectiveC, Java, <a href="http://qt-project.org/">Qt</a>, <a href="http://www.casparcg.com/" target="_blank">CasparCG</a>, ActionScript, Perl, Python, C++ and ASP.</p>

              <h1>WORKS</h1>
              <p>Some of the things I've been doing over the years</p>
			  <ul>
				  <li>
					  I'm working at <a href="http://www.chena.com" target="_blank">Chena Ventures Inc.</a> as senior developer since 2010, some of the things I've been doing there are:<br />
					  <ul>
						  <li><strong>Mundo.com:</strong> (world.com in spanish) High traffic search engine site powered by third parties, written in PHP with MySQL database.</li>
						  <li><strong>Mundo.com's Toolbar:</strong> Browser extension for Internet Explorer, Firefox and Google Chrome. It uses a backend to manage campaigns and reports written in RoR and MySQL. As the browsers mentioned before has different structures I had to use  technologies to acomplish the needs of the project, like C#, HTML, <a href="http://www.firebreath.org/display/documentation/FireBreath+Home" target="_blank">FireBreath</a> and <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Main_Page" target="_blank">Nullsoft Scriptable Install System</a> amongst other.</li>
						  <li><strong>Human Resource Management App:</strong> A RoR app with MySQL database to manage employees working hours. It uses the records from a plain text file provided by a fingerprint identification system, after parsing the file the app creates reports of working hours, extra hours, attendance and late arrivals alerts. It also manage vacations schedule, holidays, newsletters to employees and some other features. It supports multiple companies management, with custom office departments and employees profiles to handle office hours and working days depending on each case.</li>
						  <li><strong>Filematic.com's Download Manager:</strong> This is a desktop for PCs only app to download certain softwares from the site. It basically manages the download and installation of the selected software and it has extra bundled softwares offered to the users. Written in C# and RoR. The application connects to a webservice written in RoR, which handles the user interface. All the apps are generated on the server through a web based backend (here's where I used Bootstrap for the very first time) with installations reports, bundled software management and some minor user interface settings (like licenses texts). </li>
						  <li><strong>Relojes.com.py:</strong> This is a side project made on my free time as an extra work for my employer, is basically a watches and glasses online store written in RoR; it doesn't support transactions but it uses a shopping cart and handle orders (order products removal, order status, stock management, etc.). The backend has some extra features, like creating custom catalogs in PDF format for newsletters and other type of sales marketing.</li>
						  <li><strong>Billeton.com.py:</strong> One of the division of the company was a TV lottery, I was in charge of the website. Written in RoR with MySQL database, it showed the lottery results, prizes, next draw details, prize check using the lottery ticket number. For this site I used some basic API to the lottery webservices to load all the info in realtime after the draw were made, the same thing to check prizes with the ticket number.</li>
					  </ul>
				  </li>
				  <li>
					  At the end quarter of 2007 I was hired by <a href="http://www.rpc.com.py" target="_blank">Teledifusora Paraguay S.A.</a> (TV and Radio Broadcast Station) as senior developer, where amongst other things I worked on:
					  <ul>
						  <li><strong>Rpc.com.py:</strong> Official TV Channel site written in RoR and MySQL. This was my first web app with RoR. This application is much bigger that it seems, it handles TV Shows schedule, webservices, live streaming in two differents qualities with <a href="http://www.wowza.com/products" target="_blank">Wowza Streaming Engine</a>, the streaming service is turned on or off depending on the show on air. The app in some point also was used to store automatically the results from live draws in TV Shows, this module had a backend to manage the winners of each draw, generate reports and export them in XLS format. The website was also used to create press releases about TV Shows, latest news from the press department and a Blog for journalists and writters who worked at the TV station.</li>
						  <li><strong>Cardinal.com.py:</strong> This is my second project in RoR, it is the radio station site. Here I met <a href="http://sphinxsearch.com/">Sphinx</a>, as some colleagues talked me about it, I decided to give it a try. This site changed a lot from the first version, the radio station used to have two frecuencies with the same name, so it basically was one site for two radio stations, after some changes in the company structure, the site is used only for AM frecuency; all written news were removed from the site and now it only handles audio news in MP3 format, I created an audio web player using <a href="http://www.schillmania.com/projects/soundmanager2/" target="_blank">SoundManager 2</a> and it has 24/7 live audio streaming in MP3 and OGG formats, for that I mounted an <a href="http://www.icecast.org/" target="_blank">Icecast 2</a> server. For the backend of the site I used the Twitter and Bit.ly APIs to optionaly tweet the newly created news in the Radio station twitter account, aswell in the Facebook fanpage.</li>
						  <li><strong>Desktop Apps:</strong> I created some desktop apps for Windows to manage live shows graphic interfaces, most of them were for entertaiment programs. The firsts apps were written in C++ but then we moved to C#, these apps were used to connect to the <a href="http://www.orad.tv/engineframework" target="_blank">Orad's Engine Framework</a> using theirs .net API. Some apps used MySQL database, like the one for the news, and it had a web based backend running on the intranet to load all the info from the production or press department.</li>
						  <li><strong>Other stuffs:</strong> There were some other small RoR sites for TV Shows, most of them were about SMS subscriptions with prizes, or lottery-like services. Basically the sites had the description of the games or shows, rules, winners and prize checking. Some of the sites are: clubdale.com, yapa.com.py, 5022.com.py, celu.tv. I also had a chance to know a little bit about audio and video concepts, aswell as software manipulation for these kind of files like Adobe Premiere, SoundBooth and After Effects. And after some long years I worked again with Adobe Flash and ActionScript.</li>
					  </ul>
				  </li>
				  <li>I worked Freelance in 2006 and most of 2007, doing projects for clients here in Paraguay and some of them from around the globe. Most of them were in PHP with MySQL database, in this time of my professional life I met a little bit deeper to Joomla and Wordpress CMS.</li>
				  <li>Most part of 2005 I worked at <a href="http://www.internetestudio.com/" target="_blank">Internet Estudio</a> as web developer and then as project leader. Here I adquired a lot of skills about server management. Back then we worked with CentOS server, installing and configuring Apache, PHP, MySQL, SendMail and some other services when needed.</li>
				  <li>From 2002 to 2005 I worked at Chena Ventures Inc. (yes, my current job). I was hired as a junior developer and I started learning about PHP, MySQL and HTML itself! Back then, most of the sites I worked on at the beginning were for other companies, but then by 2003 we worked exclusively for own projects. I had a chance to create subscriptions sites with online transactions using PayPal, 2CheckOut and ClickBank; these sites had affilation programs, and the backend handled the reports, earnings and affiliates commisions.</li>
